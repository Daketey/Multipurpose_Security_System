## A Multipurpose Security System 
An Alert system Developed using Arduino and Visual Studio's windows forms


## Features:
1. Application starts upon sensing movement
2. Detects the face(for now) of the intruder through facial recognition
3. A turret follows the position of intruder which you can use for your custom purpose
4. Sends you a call alert repeatedly upon detecting an intruder
5. Captures a picture of the intruder every 3 secs and saves them to your computer

### Work in progress:
1. Application hides upon not detecting movement for a certain amount of time
2. The captured images get uploaded to google drive for anywhere access
3. SMS system to stop receiving the calls
4. Adding body detection for making it viable
5. Changing your phone number through the forms application
